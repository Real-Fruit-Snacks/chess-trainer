/**
 * Post-build steps for GitHub Pages.
 *
 * 1. `404.html` — Pages serves this file for any unknown path. Making it a copy
 *    of `index.html` lets deep links such as /puzzles or /learn/forks boot the
 *    SPA, which then reads the URL and renders the right route.
 * 2. `.nojekyll` — tells Pages not to run Jekyll, which would otherwise ignore
 *    files and folders that start with an underscore (Vite's asset hashes can
 *    produce those) and slow down deployments.
 * 3. `licence.txt`, `licence-agpl.txt` and `notices.txt` — the project's licence
 *    (`LICENSE`), the licence of the human-like opponent's model (Maia-3, AGPL-3.0:
 *    `LICENSES/AGPL-3.0.txt`) and the third-party notices (`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`)
 *    ship with the site, and the footer links to them. They are not precached:
 *    they are small and rarely opened, and the service worker leaves them to the
 *    network.
 * 4. Source maps — the build writes hidden maps (no `sourceMappingURL` comment);
 *    they are moved out of `dist/` into `sourcemaps/`, so they are never deployed
 *    or precached. CI keeps them as an artifact for reading crash-report stacks.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/postbuild.mjs
