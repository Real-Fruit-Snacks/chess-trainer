The sounds, the lessons, courses, endgame drills and the study annotations are original work of this
project and covered by its licence.
The game scores of the classic games and the positions of the endgame studies (Réti 1921, Saavedra 1895
and traditional endings) are public-domain facts; every annotation is written for this project.

Stockfish is GPL-3.0 software. The source code corresponding to the shipped binaries is the
[Stockfish.js v19.0.0 release](https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js/releases/tag/v19.0.0) (built from
the [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) sources it names); the exact files and
their SHA-256 checksums are pinned in `scripts/setup-engine.mjs`. The four builds are the same engine:
two embed Stockfish's small network ("lite"), two its large one ("full"), each single-threaded and with
pthreads. A full build reaches a device only when the learner switches the full engine on. The full
GPL-3.0 text ships with the site as `licence.txt`.

Maia-3 is the University of Toronto Computational Social Science Lab's model of human play (Monroe et
al., _Chessformer: A Unified Architecture for Chess Modeling_, ICLR 2026), licensed under the GNU
Affero General Public License v3. The app ships the 5M-parameter model unmodified, exactly as
published in bqrio's ONNX export at a pinned revision (the address and the SHA-256 are in
`scripts/setup-maia.mjs`); the original checkpoints are at
[huggingface.co/UofTCSSLab/Maia3-5M](https://huggingface.co/UofTCSSLab/Maia3-5M). The model reaches a
device only when the learner downloads the human-like opponent. The app combines it with its own
GPL-3.0-or-later code as section 13 of the GPL v3 allows, so the combination also falls under the
AGPL's network clause: the complete source code of the app is the repository linked from the footer of
every page. The AGPL-3.0 text ships with the site as `licence-agpl.txt`.

ONNX Runtime Web is MIT-licensed (© Microsoft Corporation; the build keeps its notice in the
human-like opponent's worker script). Its WebAssembly build contains the open-source components
listed in ONNX Runtime's
[third-party notices](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/v1.30.0/ThirdPartyNotices.txt).

The rules by which Lichess cleans study and chapter names come from scalalib (MIT); the recovery
phrase's word list is BIP-39's (MIT, Copyright (c) 2013 Marek Palatinus, Pavol Rusnak, Aaron Voisine

## Piece sets

Every set but Classic is copied unchanged from the Lichess repository (`public/piece/<set>/` in
[lichess-org/lila](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila)), where each set's author and licence are
listed in [COPYING.md](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/blob/master/COPYING.md); the build inlines
the SVGs into one stylesheet per set. `src/components/board/pieces/README.md` lists them again.

**California, Maestro, Staunty and Cardinal are licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and may not be used
commercially.** The rest of Chess Trainer is GPL-3.0-or-later and may be, but these four sets may
not: anyone who sells the app, charges for access or shows ads in it must remove them first (their
folders and stylesheets in `src/components/board/pieces/`, and their ids in
`src/store/settings.ts`, `src/components/board/pieceSets.ts`, `src/components/board/pieceStyles.ts`
and `scripts/pieces/index.mjs`).
Changes to them, if any, must be shared under the same licence.

Merida (GPL-2.0-or-later) and MPChess (GPL-3.0-or-later) are distributed under GPL-3.0, the
licence in `LICENSE`. Chessnut's Apache-2.0 licence is in `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`. Celtic's MIT

## Board themes

The twenty textured boards are Lichess's board pictures, copied unchanged from `public/images/board/`
in [lichess-org/lila](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila) to `public/boards/` (Lichess's
`canvas2.jpg`, `pink-pyramid.png` and `svg/newspaper.svg` are `canvas.jpg`, `pink.png` and
`newspaper.svg` here). [COPYING.md](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/blob/master/COPYING.md)
credits them to the lila authors and [pirouetti](https://lichess.org/@/pirouetti) under the GNU
Affero General Public License, version 3 or later. The 128-pixel previews in `public/boards/thumbs/`
are scaled-down copies made by `scripts/generate-board-thumbs.mjs`, under the same licence. As with
Maia-3, the app combines them with its own GPL-3.0-or-later code as section 13 of the GPL v3 allows:
the AGPL-3.0 text ships with the site as `licence-agpl.txt`, and the complete source code is the
repository linked from the footer of every page.

The five flat Lichess boards (Brown, Blue, IC, Green and Purple) are not pictures: the app draws
them from their two colours. Ice, Walnut and High contrast are the app's own.

## Attribution requirements

- The built site carries the licences and these notices: `scripts/postbuild.mjs` copies `LICENSE` to
  `licence.txt`, `LICENSES/AGPL-3.0.txt` to `licence-agpl.txt`, `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt` to
  `licence-apache.txt` and this file to `notices.txt` in `dist/`, and the footer of every page links
  to them. Keep them (and the engine source link above) when redistributing the site.
- Maia-3 (AGPL-3.0) is credited in the footer of every page, next to a link to its licence and one to
  the app's source code; keep both when redistributing the site.
- The board pictures (AGPL-3.0-or-later) are credited here and under the board picker in Settings,
  with a link to their licence, while one of them is the chosen board.
- Every piece set is credited here, under the piece picker in Settings, and in the footer of every
  page while it is the chosen set ("Pieces (Classic): Colin M.L. Burnett, CC BY-SA 3.0", the
  licence linked). The pieces are used unmodified.
- Puzzles are CC0 and need no attribution; a link to the source game on Lichess is shown anyway.
  Some lesson tasks and the placement quiz use positions from the same database and say so.
