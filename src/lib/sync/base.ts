/**
 * The copies of the synced data that merges are measured against: the vault
 * as this device last agreed with the relay (the base), and the data of a
 * write still on its way (see `pending` in `store/deviceSync.ts`). Each copy
 * is kept compressed in the Cache API (large enough, and out of the way of
 * localStorage's few megabytes) under a random id, and the device-sync store
 * names the ids in use. A copy is written once, under a new id, and never
 * changed, so an id always means one exact copy: a later save cannot be
 * mistaken for it, and a save that failed leaves no older copy behind under
 * its name.
 *
 * This tab also keeps the copies it saved or read in memory: the Cache API is
 * missing in some private windows, and a save can fail on a full disk. Another
 * tab, or the next start, without the copy merges without a base, which joins
 * both sides and loses nothing.
 *
 * Forgetting the base (when the data was replaced from outside the sync, or
 * storage failed half-way through a merge) writes a new mark under a
 * localStorage key of its own, which every tab reads straight from storage. A
 * base agreed under another mark is not used, so a tab that still holds the
 * old base in memory does not bring it back.
