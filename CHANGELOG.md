# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Glicko-2 puzzle rating.** The rating now carries an uncertainty (shown as "± 60" everywhere it
  appears) and a volatility, and is updated with the system Lichess uses, verified against the worked
  example in Glickman's paper. The puzzle's own rating deviation from the Lichess data weights each
  result.
- **Calibration run.** New learners can let twelve rated puzzles find their level instead of guessing it
  (a self-assessment is still available and starts less uncertain); the Progress page can restart a
  calibration at any time.
- **What an attempt is worth** now depends on how it went: hints cost credit according to what they
  revealed (the piece: 0.6, the whole move: 0.25), a solve that was slow for the puzzle's size and
  difficulty earns less (never below 0.75), and a puzzle seen before applies only a quarter of its
  update.
- **Inactivity.** The deviation grows during breaks (a settled rating becomes provisional again after
  about a year away), so a returning learner's first solves count more.
- **What the rating means.** A Progress card converts the puzzle rating into rough Lichess, chess.com
  and FIDE ranges (±150), with the caveats spelled out; the FAQ explains the ± figure.

### Changed

- The puzzle rating is consistently called a *puzzle* rating; "provisional" now means the deviation is
  at least 110 rather than "fewer than 30 rated puzzles".
- Progress store version 5 and export version 4: older saves and exports get a deviation derived from
  how many rated puzzles their Elo rating had seen, and the last rated time from the rating history.
- Attempts record the hint level and the Glicko score they were worth.

### Removed

- The Elo K-factor schedule (`updateRating`, `kFactor`, `PROVISIONAL_GAMES`).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Puzzles from your own games:** every mistake or blunder found by a game review (Analyze or My games)
  can become a puzzle — one click per moment or "Add N as puzzles" for the whole game — and a new
  **Mine** mode on the Puzzles page drills them; solved and failed ones follow the 1-3-7-14-30 review
  schedule. Any puzzle can be **bookmarked** (☆) into the same queue.
- **My games** (`/games`): import games from Lichess or chess.com (time control, colour and rated
  filters, "load older games"), or paste a PGN; an overview of results, **opening statistics** per colour
  by family, a **repertoire tab** that shows where you or your opponents left the lines you study
  (deviated / opponent left / in book, with "study line" and "analyze position" links), one-click
  **review of every game** in a batch, and "add as puzzles" for the mistakes found.
- **Home:** the daily plan adapts — it targets your weakest puzzle theme when the accuracy drops below
  70 %, rotates through every drill, and adds due lesson recalls; the current course and its next item
  are shown.
- **Progress:** a **weekly summary** (puzzles, accuracy, lessons, games, drills, training days, rating
  change against the previous week) and an **engine diagnostics** panel (build in use, WebAssembly, cores,
  isolation, service worker) with a "Test the engine" speed check.
- **Courses:** First steps, Club player and Strategy & calculation — guided paths of lessons, drills,
  puzzle and repertoire targets, engine games and classic games, with units that unlock in order and a
  "Continue" button that goes to the next item.
- **Lesson recall:** three days after finishing a lesson its tasks come back as recall cards
  (`/learn/recall`); a miss brings the card back sooner and "reread the lesson" jumps to the step.
- **Learn:** eight lessons — pawn endgames II (breakthrough, outflanking, the spare tempo), rook endgames
  III (cutting the king off, checking from behind, Vancura), how to study openings, good and bad bishops,
  opposite-side castling (with Karpov–Korchnoi 1974), converting an extra pawn, candidate moves and
  elimination (Réti–Tartakower and Marshall's Qg3), and planning from the pawn structure (hanging pawns
  and the Maróczy Bind) — 33 engine-verified tasks, all placed in the courses.
- **Endgame studies** (`/studies`): eight composed positions with a single solution — Réti's king walk,
  the Saavedra position, the classic breakthrough, knight underpromotion, one pawn down, the rook's
  last trick and two only-move king endings — solved move by move with hints, notes after every move,
  "play it out" against the engine and a record of clean solves. Every line is verified by
  `npm run studies:verify`.
- **Guess the position** drill: the opening of a famous game as text, an empty board, and three questions
  about where the pieces stand now (captures, castling and en passant included).
- **Play:** **two players at one device** (the board can turn towards the side to move; the side to move
  resigns; games are not counted as engine games) and **blindfold** play with a peek button and a peek
  counter.
- **Classic games:** Capablanca–Marshall 1918 (the Marshall Attack), Lasker–Capablanca 1914,
  Short–Timman 1991 (the king walk) and Fischer–Spassky 1972, game 6.
- **Openings:** French Defence and English Opening repertoires.
- **Keyboard board control:** Tab to any board, move a square cursor with the arrow keys, select a piece
  and its destination with Enter, clear with Escape, or type a square name to jump to it; a visually
  hidden "Describe position" button reads the whole position out. The shortcuts dialog lists it.
- **Shareable links:** "Copy link" on the analysis board puts the game (deflated) or the position in the
  URL fragment — `/analyze#z=…&ply=N` — so nothing is sent anywhere and the link opens at the same move.
- **Appearance:** an original **Letters** piece set (high legibility on small boards) and a **soft**
  sound theme.

### Changed

- The lesson content is no longer loaded on the Home, Progress and course pages: a generated index
  (`src/features/learn/lessonMeta.ts`, `npm run lessons:index`, run before every build) carries the
  titles and lengths, which keeps ~55 kB of gzipped JavaScript off the first page load.
- Toasts stay in the bottom-right corner on wide screens so they never cover the board.
- Interactive boards expose `role="application"` with a description; view-only boards stay images.
- The "My games" and "Endgame studies" pages are in the More menu; the Play page header describes both
  opponents.
- Progress export version 3 (adds own puzzles, lesson recall and study results); the store migrates
  older saves.

### Fixed

- A reply animation could swallow the next click on the board in the studies e2e flow; the tests now
  dismiss toasts and wait for the animation.
- `useNow()` re-reads the clock when the review queue changes, so due counts update immediately after a
  bookmark or a solve.
- Opening a shared game at a given move no longer depends on stale tree state (`loadPgn(pgn, atPly)`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Game review:** an evaluation graph (click or use the arrow keys to jump to any move), a list of key
  moments (the biggest mistakes, one click away), a choice of review depth with a time estimate, and a
  "retry from here against the engine" link on every reviewed move.
- **Play from any position:** start a game from a FEN (`/play?fen=…`), from any position on the analysis
  board, from a lesson diagram, from a solved puzzle or from a moment of a reviewed game. Custom starts show
  the correct move numbers and hide the material count.
- **Import games:** paste or open a PGN with several games and pick one, or fetch the most recent games of
  a Lichess or chess.com player by username (public APIs, nothing uploaded; usernames are remembered).
- **Puzzle review queue:** missed puzzles (rated, themed, daily or rush) come back after 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30
  days; a hint keeps the card on its step. The Puzzles page shows the due count, the Progress page counts
  the queue and the daily plan includes it.
- **Home:** a first-run tour, a daily plan (daily puzzle, five rated puzzles, review queue, opening reviews,
  the next lesson and a drill) and a training-day streak across every activity.
- **Learn:** eight lessons — the isolated queen's pawn, outposts and weak squares, the minority attack,
  fortresses and zugzwang, rook against a minor piece, queen endgames, attacking the uncastled king and
  visualisation — with 27 engine-verified tasks.
- **Drills:** Vancura, wrong bishop (hold), bishop and knight in the wrong corner, queen vs rook and queen
  vs pawn (win the last piece); a blindfold mode for the board-vision drills.
- **Classic games:** Byrne–Fischer (the Game of the Century), Botvinnik–Capablanca, Karpov–Kasparov 1985
  (the Octopus Knight) and Kasparov–Topalov.
- **Openings:** King's Indian Attack and Slav Defence repertoires.
- **Multi-threaded engine (experimental):** a hand-written Workbox service worker (`src/sw.ts`) that can add
  the COOP/COEP headers itself, so the pthreads Stockfish build runs on GitHub Pages when the learner opts
  in; the thread count is shown in the analysis status line and the app falls back to the single-threaded
  build automatically.
- **Accessibility:** every move is announced to screen readers, a keyboard-shortcut reference (`?`), focus
  moves to the new page after navigation, a colour-blind-safe high-contrast board theme (Okabe–Ito
  highlights), `prefers-reduced-motion` disables board animation, and text colours meet WCAG AA contrast.

### Changed

- The review queue keeps the last card on the board until "Next" so the solution can be studied.
- Tall dialogs scroll inside the dialog instead of pushing the title off screen.
- Game review depth is a setting (fast / balanced / thorough).
- Endgame drill positions are checked in CI to be legal and to not start in check.

### Fixed

- Two lesson tasks that Stockfish rated below the accepted tolerance at depth 18: the queenside
  castling example now uses a Sicilian Yugoslav Attack position where O-O-O is the best move, and the
  Blackburne Shilling "decline the bait" task no longer accepts c3.
- The threaded engine's worker scripts are served with the isolation headers too (a dedicated worker
  must be at least as isolated as the page that spawns it).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Play:** clocks with bullet, blitz, rapid and classical time controls (loss on time, engine think
  time capped by its remaining time, low-time warning), keyboard move entry, "show threat", automatic
  level suggestions after two wins or two losses in a row.
- **Analysis:** full variation tree (play a move from anywhere to create a variation; promote, delete,
  annotate with glyphs and comments; PGN export with variations), keyboard navigation, ECO opening names,
  board editor with position validation, PGN download, optional Lichess tablebase lookups (off by default).
- **Puzzles:** Puzzle Rush (3-minute and survival modes), per-theme accuracy with a strengths and
  weaknesses report on the Progress page, and a puzzle set doubled to 8,000 (1,000 per rating band).
- **Drills:** coordinate trainer, piece-movement / find-every-capture / find-every-check drills, and
  checkmate and endgame drills (KQ, KR, two bishops, bishop and knight, king and pawn win and hold,
  Lucena, Philidor) played against the full-strength engine with automatic adjudication and best results.
- **Openings:** repertoire trainer with six built-in repertoires (Italian, London, Queen's Gambit,
  Caro-Kann, Queen's Gambit Declined, Scandinavian), custom PGN import, SM-2 spaced repetition, an
  explore mode and due/learned statistics.
- **Classic games:** guess-the-move for seven annotated masterpieces with engine grading of alternatives.
- **Learn:** fourteen new lessons (draws and how games end, opening traps, trading pieces, pawn races,
  minor-piece endgames, opposite-coloured bishops, queen vs pawn, rook endgames II, the active king,
  building a repertoire, space and pawn breaks, the exchange sacrifice, the bishop pair, analysing your
  games); every lesson task is now verified against Stockfish by `npm run lessons:verify`.
- **Reference:** rules of chess, notation (SAN, PGN, FEN, engine evaluations), searchable glossary and FAQ.
- Sound effects (synthesised, no audio files), a settings switch for them, and a redesigned navigation
  with a "More" menu on desktop and a bottom sheet on phones.

### Changed

- Progress export now includes the opening repertoire data; importing an older export still works.
- The Home page presents all sections; the Progress page has a training summary card.

### Fixed

- Two beginner lesson positions where the taught move was objectively poor (the examples now keep the
  balance so the engine agrees with the lesson).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Interactive lesson curriculum (21 lessons across beginner, intermediate and advanced levels) with
  engine-verified positions and per-step progress tracking.
- Puzzle trainer with 4,000 bundled Lichess puzzles, rating-aware selection, an Elo-style rating,
  daily puzzle, practice by theme, hints, solutions and day streaks.
- Play against Stockfish 19 (WASM) at eight strength levels with take-backs, hints, resignation,
  PGN export and hand-off to the analysis board.
- Analysis board with multi-line evaluation, evaluation bar, FEN/PGN import and one-click game
  review (accuracy, inaccuracies, mistakes, blunders, better moves).
- Progress page with rating history chart, statistics, recent puzzles/games, settings and JSON
  export/import.
- Progressive Web App: manifest, icons, offline precaching of the whole app (engine and puzzles
  included), install prompt, update notifications.
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI (lint, typecheck, unit + e2e tests, build) and GitHub Pages deployment.
